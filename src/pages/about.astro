        <h3>What We've Been Doing</h3>
        <p class="ourteam">
          Thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, parents, students,
          School Foundation, Parent Council, School Council, our school, and the
          tech department, we have been able to participate in the FIRST
          Robotics Competition (FRC). FRC is an international robotics
          competition where high school teams design, build and program a robot
          to compete in a themed game. Throughout the build-season we have been
          able to develop our skills across various fields including: computer
          aided design (CAD) software, computerized numerical control (CNC)
          machines, 3D printers, programming, electronics control system design,
          business development and problem-solving.
